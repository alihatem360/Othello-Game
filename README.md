# Othello-Game


**An Intelligent Othello Player using an Alpha-Beta Depth-First algorithm (designing
& implementing at least 2 heuristic functions)**


Build an artificial Othello player, that can play games against a human opponent. Reversi is a strategy board
game for two players, played on an 8×8 uncheckered board. It was invented in 1883. The modern version/variant
of the game — the most regularly used rule-set, and the one used in international tournaments — is marketed
and recognized as Othello (was patented in 1971). The game - Othello - differs from Reversi in that the first four
pieces go in the center, but in a standard diagonal pattern, rather than being placed by players. Additionally,
where Reversi ends as soon as either player cannot make a move, in Othello the player without a move simply
passes.
